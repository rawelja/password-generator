## Tests

Tests are located under the `tests/` directory and are split into:

- Unit tests - Tests a single class or function
- Feature tests - Tests a feature (one or more classes/functions together)

Tests are run using the [PHPUnit](https://phpunit.de/) library.
[PCOV](https://github.com/krakjoe/pcov) is used for coverage report.
(PCOV is used instead of Xdebug for speed).

`composer test` or
`composer test-coverage`
